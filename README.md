# Extenuating Package Development Area

This organization supplements my main account `awqx` and is mainly to allow for forking my own repos in special circumstances. 

- `fastFMMconc` is a fork of `awqx/fastFMM` that will allow for collaborators to test beta functions of `fastFMM` without uninstalling their own version of `fastFMM`.
