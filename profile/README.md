# Special package development area

This organization supplements my main account awqx and is mainly to allow for forking my own repos in special circumstances.

- `fastFMMconc` is a fork of `awqx/fastFMM` that will allow for collaborators to test beta functions of fastFMM without uninstalling their own version of fastFMM.
